# Agentic Systems

This module introduces **Agentic Systems powered by Large Language Models (LLMs)**.
The goal is to demonstrate how LLMs can coordinate multiple agents, tools, and workflows to solve tasks autonomously.

We explore different libraries and frameworks that support agentic design:

* **[CrewAI](./crewai/)** → Define agents, tasks, and tools for multi-agent orchestration.
* **[n8n](./n8n/)** → Low-code workflow automation with LLM-powered agents.
* **LangGraph (coming soon)** → Graph-based orchestration of agent workflows.

Each subdirectory contains a self-contained example with installation and usage instructions.
